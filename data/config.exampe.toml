# The status of the bot when it is online (will not be set if the bot is run in debug mode)

[fishing]

# scale of 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means no chance of catching a fish and 1.0 means guaranteed catch
base_catch_chance = 0.5
# fish_value_calculation - Determines how the value of fish is calculated for the bot. Options include:
#  - Averaged: Uses a "Fair Market" Approach, averaging the size and weight variations of the fish to affect value
#     (More stable, less extreme highs and lows)
#  - Multiplicative: Uses a "Multiplicative" Approach, multiplying the size and weight variations of the fish to affect value
#     (Way more drastic, Higher highs and lower lows)
fish_value_calculation = "Multiplicitive"

[bait]
# The weights (or effectiveness) of the different bait attributes
low_bait_weight = 1.5
