#  - Averaged: Uses a "Fair Market" Approach, averaging the size and weight variations of the fish to affect value
#     (More stable, less extreme highs and lows)
#  - Multiplicative: Uses a "Multiplicative" Approach, multiplying the size and weight variations of the fish to affect value
#     (Way more drastic, Higher highs and lower lows)
