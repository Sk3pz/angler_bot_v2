  - [ ] Shop to buy new rods (rebalance)  
  - [ ] Bestiary of fish types caught

- [ ] Fishing events  
  - [ ] ~~Legendary Fish - rare fish with unique names and descriptions that can be caught (i.e. Loch Ness Monster, Giant Squid, etc.)~~  
          (Moved to Mythcial rarity, but are treated as normal fish)  
  - [ ] Seasonal Fish - fish that can only be caught during certain times of the year (e.g., Christmas fish, Halloween fish, etc.)  
          (Planned for distant future update)  
  - [ ] Junk / Trash - no value, just a nuisance (no longer treat them as a fish like v1)  
  - [ ] Treasure - random amount of money or a random item (e.g., bait, rod upgrade, etc.)  
  - [ ] Angler's Anomaly - Some random events that can occur while fishing that provide lore / story to the game world  
          (Later story update)  
- [ ] Traps for catching fish automatically (require occasional restocking of bait and emptying of the trap)  
- [ ] Implement weather effects on fishing  
  - [ ] Different fish appear in different weather  
  - [ ] Weather affects catch rates  
  - [ ] Weather shown in embeds when fishing instead of globally  
- [ ] Consider Gambling mechanics with fish (would require users keep their fish in their inventory)  
- [ ] Daily quests for fishing  
- [ ] Story and lore in the world  
  - [ ] Fish up notes and letters to provide lore  
  - [ ] All referencing Christianity and Jesus, especially becoming a fisherman of men instead of fish
